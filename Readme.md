## Image Scraper

> Image scraping is important during the process of deep learning. We need hundreds and thousands of photos to feed to the model. This app I created can download as many number of images as required. 
> The app is made using Flask framework and selenium browser. 

> Make sure to download and keep the chromedriver in the same folder.
